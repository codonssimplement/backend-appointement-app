# backend-appointement-app
In this backend we will use Nest js and mongoDB as a database to implement the Backend part of our appointment application. we will therefore have user authentication modules - crud rendez-vous and crud doctor - crud patient - admin

##Logic of our approach: we start from the principle that the platform is specific to the structure and knowing that the structure normally has more patients than doctors so we consider by default the user as a patient, and the users who reach the rank of doctor must be validated by an administrator. Appointment scheduling and availability of an appointment depends on availability.
